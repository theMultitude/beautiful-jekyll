**__What makes a good Data Scientist?__**   Data manupulation? Data presentation?  How about insights, those gems that fight for the bottom line and show us our foibles, inform the masses and reshape our worlviews for the better?  All of these are imporant, but at bottom, they rely upon this: the ability to ask good questions. 

That is what I try to bring to every project I encounter.

### my history

To be honest, I'm having some trouble remembering right now, so why don't you just watch [my movie](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Princess_Bride_%28film%29) and it will answer **all** your questions.
